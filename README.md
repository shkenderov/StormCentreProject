# StormCentreProject
A java project using JFrame GUI and JFrame testing

##Content
This project was designed to make use of polymorphism, abstraction and aggregation. 
The Storm class is abstract and the Hurricane, Tornado and Blizzard extend it.
In the system class, they are put into an array so they can be stored when inputted by the user.
The MainScreen class implements JFrame and uses action listener for the buttons in the GUI. 
All of the classes are tested via JUnit.
